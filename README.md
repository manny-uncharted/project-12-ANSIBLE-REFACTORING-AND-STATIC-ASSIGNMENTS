## Introduction
In this project, we would be refactoring the ansible code to make it more modular and reusable than the previous project. We would be learning how to create assignments, and learn how to use the imports functionality.

Imports allow us to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook. This is a very powerful feature of Ansible and allows us to create a playbook that is very modular and reusable.
