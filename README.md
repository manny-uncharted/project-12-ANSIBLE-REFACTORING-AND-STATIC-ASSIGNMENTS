## Introduction
In this project, we would be refactoring the ansible code to make it more modular and reusable than the previous project. We would be learning how to create assignments, and learn how to use the imports functionality.

Imports allow us to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook. This is a very powerful feature of Ansible and allows us to create a playbook that is very modular and reusable.

### Code Refactoring
Refactoring is a general term in computer programming. It means making changes to the source code without changing the expected behavior of the software. The main idea of refactoring is to enhance code readability, increase maintainability and extensibility, reduce complexity, and add proper comments without affecting the logic.

In this case, we would move things around a little bit in the code, but the overall state of the infrastructure would remain the same.
